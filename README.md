Klovnstation 14 _(KS14)_ is a fork of [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14).
We use the [Robust Toolbox engine](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox).

If you want to host or create content for base SS14, go to the [Space Station 14 repository](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14), as it is holds all base code and resources for SS14 forks.

## Documentation/Wiki

The [Wizard's Den docs site](https://docs.spacestation14.com/) has documentation on SS14's (and by extension, also KS14's) content, engine, game design, and more, including code standards.
