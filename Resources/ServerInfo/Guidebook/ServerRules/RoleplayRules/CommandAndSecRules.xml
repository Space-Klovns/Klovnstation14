# Command and Security rules

You, as command or sec, have three goals. Keep the shift going for as long as possible, keep as many people alive as possible, and keep the station advancing along its gameplay curve.
To achieve these goals you have been given extremely potent equipment and supreme authority.

## Point number one: keep the shift going
This is simple enough. Repair damage, prevent harm and in general try to keep the station in the same condition as it was roundstart or even better (if someone decides to improve it).
If you ascertain that damage repair is beyond your capability or the amount of dead is beyond recovery, then you are to call evac. You can call evac when the sentiment of the station crew is overwhelmingly for it as well, but you should try to make sure that it isn't.

## Point number two: keep people in the round
This is the most important point. If you behead 2 assistants just because they were being detrimental to the station that is 2 people out of the round. This is simply to prevent the admins needing to spawn many ghost roles. While we try to leave you as much freedom as possible, understand that you are the IC equivalent of us preventing needless round removal.
You have been given tools to prevent RR. Here are some of them:
You have been given tools to prevent RR. Here are some of them:

### borging
Cyborgs have to obey their laws, lest they get banned. By making people into cyborgs you keep them in the game and disallow their fuckery.

### projects
Nothing gets people together more than a fun project to do. Announce a stationwide project, say a shuttle build, and get problem players to work on it.

### parole equipment
This applies especially well with the station AI present. Something like an electropack linked to a button can shut down people when they start to cause problems. Do not be afraid to use the jail system. Most people actually change their mind after 10 minutes or so in the brig.

### mindshield
Mindshield implants are your most powerful tool. They force people to obey the same ruleset as you do. If the station works well and has a lot of money, you will be able to use mindshields to prevent the worst of the worst from fucking the station up. Remember, acting against mindshield is ahelpable.

## Point three: let the station advance
This is closely intertwined with point two, but let me reiterate: a station with no engineering, scientific, service or cargo projects is BORING! It is not fun to play on such a station.
The job of you and sec is to make sure the people that want to advance can. See to it that new technologies are researched and fun projects are greenlit. Clown wants a conveyor belt hell across the station? Let him, and give him the resources. You never know when you will be able to use it say for moving crates or gas cans.
