<!-- READ THIS BEFORE CONTRIBUTING TO KS14!!!
NOTE: You must not port AGPL content that is utilised by any other MIT/MPL/otherwise non-AGPL licensed content. This is due to the viral nature
of AGPL, where any code that uses AGPL must itself be licensed under AGPL. You are heavily discouraged from having code licensed under the AGPL in your PR.

The REUSE Specification headers or separate .license files indicate a secondary license (e.g., AGPL or MIT) solely to facilitate 
integration for projects that do not use the MPL license.

REUSE headers already included in files relevant to the PR, or edited after being automatically edited, will not be overriden by the bot.

Uncomment and modify the following line if you wish to change the license from the default of MPL. Set to `AGPL` for AGPL-3.0-or-later, `MPL` for MPL-2.0, and `MIT` for MIT.
