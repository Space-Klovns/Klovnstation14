# Reporting a security vulnerability
You can report a security vulnerability through Discord.

If you want to contact us through Discord, you can join [our server](https://discord.gg/rSjZ48VnMx)
and then **privately** message anyone with the `@Klovn` role.

In either case, **do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we explicitly give
you permission to do so**.
